### Flow Field Playground

This visualization was created with the help of Keith Peter's article in medium, [Flow Fields (parts I and II)](https://medium.com/@bit101/flow-fields-part-i-3ebebc688fd8), both in conceptual approach and actual code, leveraging the perlin noise generator.

This prototype is built with d3 in vanilla javascript, drawing lines on a canvas.
